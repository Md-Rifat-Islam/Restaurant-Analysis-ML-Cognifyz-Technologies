TASK LIST
Welcome to our exciting Machine Learning internship program! To complete this internship, you will
have the chance to choose any 3 Tasks Out of 4 Tasks . We've designed these Tasks to cater to your
convenience and ensure an engaging and rewarding experience. Additionally, the successful
completion of all tasks will further enhance your chances of receiving a stipend.Task 1
Cognifyz
Where Data Meets Intelligence
Task: Predict Restaurant Ratings
Objective: Build a machine learning model to predict the
aggregate rating of a restaurant based on other features.
Steps:
Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values,
encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data
into training and testing sets.
Select a regression algorithm (e.g., linear regression,
decision tree regression) and train it on the training data.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate
regression metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared)
on the testing data.
Interpret the model's results and analyze the most
influential features affecting restaurant ratings.Task 2
Cognifyz
Task: Restaurant Recommendation
Where Data Meets Intelligence
Objective: Create a restaurant recommendation
system based on user preferences.
Steps:
Preprocess the dataset by handling missing
values and encoding categorical variables.
Determine the criteria for restaurant
recommendations (e.g., cuisine preference,
price range).
Implement a content-based filtering
approach where users are recommended
restaurants similar to their preferred criteria.
Test the recommendation system by
providing sample user preferences and
evaluating the quality of recommendations.Task 3
Cognifyz
Task: Cuisine Classification
Where Data Meets Intelligence
Objective: Develop a machine learning model to
classify restaurants based on their cuisines.
Steps:
Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values
and encoding categorical variables.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Select a classification algorithm (e.g., logistic
regression, random forest) and train it on the
training data.
Evaluate the model's performance using
appropriate classification metrics (e.g., accuracy,
precision, recall) on the testing data.
Analyze the model's performance across different
cuisines and identify any challenges or biases.Task 4
Cognifyz
Task: Location-based Analysis
Where Data Meets Intelligence
Objective: Perform a geographical analysis of the
restaurants in the dataset.
Steps:
Explore the latitude and longitude coordinates of
the restaurants and visualize their distribution on a
map.
Group the restaurants by city or locality and
analyze the concentration of restaurants in
different areas.
Calculate statistics such as the average ratings,
cuisines, or price ranges by city or locality.
Identify any interesting insights or patterns related
to the locations of the restaurants.
