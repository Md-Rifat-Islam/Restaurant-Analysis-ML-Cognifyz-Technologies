# Restaurant Analysis - Machine Learning Internship @ Cognifyz Technologies

## About

This repository contains the tasks completed during my Machine Learning internship at Cognifyz Technologies. The tasks demonstrate my ability to preprocess data, develop machine learning models, and extract meaningful insights. Each task is implemented with thorough documentation and focuses on a specific area of restaurant analysis.

## Internship Tasks

### Task 1: Predict Restaurant Ratings

**Objective:** Build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on other features.

**Steps:**

1. Preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
2. Trained regression models, including Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression.
3. Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
4. Interpreted results and identified key features influencing restaurant ratings.

### Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation System

**Objective:** Create a recommendation system to suggest restaurants based on user preferences.

**Steps:**

1. Preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
2. Defined recommendation criteria such as cuisine preference and price range.
3. Implemented a content-based filtering approach to recommend restaurants similar to user preferences.
4. Evaluated the quality of recommendations by testing with sample user inputs.

### Task 3: Cuisine Classification

**Objective:** Develop a machine learning model to classify restaurants based on their cuisines.

**Steps:**

1. Preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Trained classification models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
4. Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.
5. Analyzed challenges and biases in classifying different cuisines.

**Note:** This task required significant computational power due to the heavy model training. Running this task may require a powerful GPU.

### Task 4: Location-Based Analysis

**Objective:** Perform geographical analysis of restaurants in the dataset.

**Steps:**

1. Explored the latitude and longitude coordinates of restaurants and visualized their distribution on a map.
2. Grouped restaurants by city or locality and analyzed their concentration.
3. Calculated statistics such as average ratings, cuisines, and price ranges by city or locality.
4. Identified patterns and insights related to restaurant locations.
